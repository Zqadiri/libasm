; A system call allows a userspace program to interface with kernel.
; The protection mechanism provided by Linux doesnâ€™t allow a userspace program to directly 
; invoke the Kernel. Instead it needs cooperation with some hardware via software interrupts 
; to transition from userspace to kernel space. 
; This prevents userspace program to interfere with the kernel protection mechanisms.
